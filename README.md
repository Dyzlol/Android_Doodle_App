Android Doodle App for CMSC434 and My Kids

How to run it:
- Build the repo and run it on phone? Works on my Nexus 6P and he Emulator 

Things that need work:
- Save Feature implemented but doesn't work
- Import Feature not yet implemented
- Move seekbar slightly higher (hard to touch)
- Maybe smaller icons, but my kids like the big buttons
